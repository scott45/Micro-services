Microservices in a nutshell (thoughtworks)

- designing software apps as suites of independently deployable services.

- architectural style is an approach to develop a single application as a suite of small services, each running it's own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an http resource API.

- services are independently deployable by fully automated deployable workflows.

- services maybe written in different programming languages and using different data storage technologies.

- monolithic instead are built as a single unit. (clientside, database and serverside which is monolithic with single logical execution.)
