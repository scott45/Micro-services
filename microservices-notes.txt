Microservices in a nutshell (thoughtworks)

- designing software apps as suites of independently deployable services.

- architectural style is an approach to develop a single application as a suite of small services, each running it's own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an http resource API.

- services are independently deployable by fully automated deployable workflows.

- services maybe written in different programming languages and using different data storage technologies.

- monolithic instead are built as a single unit. (clientside, database and serverside which is monolithic with single logical execution.)
logic for handling a request runs in a single process. (language dividng app into classes, functions and namespaces)
monolith apps can be scaled by running many instances behind a load-balancer
monolith apps are succesful but frustarting on change cycles, as small changes require whole app to be rebuilt and deployed. 
hard to keep a modular structure, thus difficult to keep chnages changes of a module within itself.
scaling requires scaling of the entire application.
